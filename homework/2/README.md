# Homework 2

Description: <https://ocw.cs.pub.ro/courses/sd-ca/teme/tema2-2020>.

The solution is based on Laboratory 4. All algorithms
were implemented exactly as stated in the homework.

## Task 1

I implemented the frequency vector with a simple array, I decided that for
this homework the added overhead for any of the data structures
necessary is too big (wrappers, headers, ...).

## Task 2

I first went through the input file to count how many strings were in
he then initialized a mini-dictionary that holds the key to each string,
the string itself, and its number of occurrences.

## Task 3

I used macro definitions for bitwise operations to increase the speed of
running the algorithm. I used a simple array and observed it experimentally
as the final formula must be multiplied by 2.
