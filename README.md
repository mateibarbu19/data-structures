## 1. Repository description

This project provides solutions to the
[Open CourseWare](https://ocw.cs.pub.ro/courses/sd-ca) Data Structures
Laboratories (and course homework) taught at
[Politehnica University of Bucharest](https://upb.ro), during the second
semester of the university year 2019-2020.

I created this repository for the following reasons:

1. the huge efforts I put in [Academia Network](homework/3), **which was one of
    my best projects**
2. fear of missing out, since most colleagues have some form of a data structures
    repository on their personal GitHub page
3. historical purposes, which kinda sums up points 1-2

For more information or a syllabus check out the course description
[page here](https://cs.pub.ro/index.php/education/courses/58-under/an1unger/103-data-structures)
. This course was taught by Alexandru Corneliu Olteanu.

## 2. Acknowledgments

I would like to thank [Teodor Du»õu](https://github.com/teodutu) for all his
support.
