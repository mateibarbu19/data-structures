# Laboratories

Because this code for historical purposes only, this is the only README.

Each sub folder contains my solutions for each laboratory. Though each lab
initial infrastructure is different, this makes for a great mental challenge
to be able to maintain an abstract idea, and implement it differently each time.

Labs form 8 and up are accompanied by a [checker](checker.py).
